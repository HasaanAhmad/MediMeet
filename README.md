**COMSATS University Islamabad, Semester 3 Project (Doctors Appointment System aka _MediMeet_)**

## Description

The Doctor Appointment Management System is a comprehensive and user-friendly Java app designed to streamline and automate the process of managing appointments between doctors and patients. It provides a convenient platform for doctors, patients, and administrators to interact, schedule appointments, and maintain essential medical records.

## Key Features

1. **User Registration and Login**: The system allows doctors, patients, and administrators to register their profiles and securely log in using their credentials.

2. **Doctor Dashboard**: Doctors can access their personalized dashboard to manage their appointments, view patient details, and prescribe medications. They can also maintain their professional profiles, including specialization, qualifications, etc.

3. **Patient Dashboard**: Patients have their own dashboard to schedule appointments with preferred doctors, view upcoming and past appointments, and access prescriptions. They also have the ability to cancel an upcoming appointment or remove a past appointment.

4. **Appointment Scheduling**: Patients can search for available doctors, view their availability, and book appointments at suitable dates and times.

5. **Admin Panel**: Administrators have administrative privileges to manage the system, including user registration, doctor profiles, patient profiles, appointment management, and generating reports. They can add or remove doctors and patients from the system and oversee the overall functionality.

6. **Prescription Management**: Doctors can generate and store electronic prescriptions for patients, including details of prescribed medications, dosage instructions, and duration. Patients can access and download their prescriptions for reference and follow-up purposes.

## Folder Structure
