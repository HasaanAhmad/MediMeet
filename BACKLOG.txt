VERSION 0.1 BACKLOG (Modified April 8, 2023):

1. Java server will be developed with API endpoints for /login, /signup, /create_appointment
   and /search_doctor. -- These API endpoints will be called by the Java language client to display
   and modify the content.
   Responsibility of @Mujtaba (mujtaba-io) to develop this server.

2. Java language client will be developed which will use the above mentioned APIs to view/edit/display
   the data. For stub purposes, initially data will be displayed only using print statements until the
   GUI portion is completed.
   Responsibility of @Hasaan () to develop this API communication module.

3. GUI for the above function needs to be designed and implemented. It should be such that no more than
   basic data will be displayed such as doctor/patients's name and IDs. The detailed data will be displayed
   during the 2nd increment.
   Responsibility of @Haider () to develop this GUI.
